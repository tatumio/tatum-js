 * Listing can be offered for native asset - ETH, BSC, etc. - or any ERC20 token - this is configurable during listing creation.
 * Once the listing is created, seller must send the NFT asset to the smart contract.
 * Buyer will buy the asset from the listing using native asset - send assets along the buyAssetFromListing() smart contract call, or via ERC20 token.
 * Buyer of the listing must perform approval for the smart contract to access ERC20 token, before the actual buyAssetFromListing() method is called.
 * Once both assets - from buyer and seller - are in the smart contract, NFT is sent to the buyer, price is sent to the seller
