     * <p>Create a deposit address associated with a virtual account.</p>
     * <p>You can create multiple deposit addresses for one virtual account. When you have multiple deposit addresses created for the same virtual account, you aggregate various blockchain transactions from different addresses under a single account.<br/>You can deposit funds from another blockchain address to a deposit address associated with the virtual account, and the funds will be credited to that virtual account.</p>
     * <p><b>Scanning for incoming deposits</b></p>
     * <p>By default, deposit addresses are scanned for incoming deposits. Deposit addresses are automatically synchronized with the associated virtual account, and you can see incoming deposits on the virtual account.<br/>Scanning deposit addresses for incoming deposits consumes <b>20 credits per address per day</b>.</p>

     * <li><b>DestinationTag</b> for XRP</li>

     * <p>Deposit addresses are generated in the natural order of the extended public key provided in the virtual account. The derivation index is the representation of that order; it starts from 0 and ends at 2^31.</p>
     * <p>When a new deposit address is generated, the last not used index is used to generate the address. You can skip some addresses to a different index, which means all the skipped addresses will no longer be used.</p>

     * @param index <p>Derivation path index for specific address. If not present, last used index for given xpub of account + 1 is used. We recommend not to pass this value manually, since when some of the indexes are skipped, it is not possible to use them lately to generate address from it.</p>
