To learn more about the\nTatum blockchain development framework, visit [our website](https://tatum.io/framework).\n\nThe Tatum API features powerful endpoints that simplify a complex blockchain into single API requests. Code for all\nsupported blockchains using unified API calls.\n\n## Supported blockchains\n\nTatum supports multiple blockchains and various blockchain features.\n\nBecause not all blockchains function identically, Tatum supports a different set of features on each blockchain.\n\nTo see all the blockchains that Tatum supports, please refer to [this article](https://docs.tatum.io/introduction/supported-blockchains).\n\n## Need help?\n\nTo chat with other developers, get help from the Support team, and engage with the thriving Tatum community, join \nour [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tatum).

It is an envelope that holds essential information about balances, the state of the account or customer, and to whom the account belongs.<br/><br/>\nAccounts in Tatum are stored within Tatum Private Ledger. Tatum Private Ledger contains information about accounts, the customers that own the accounts, transactions that affect the accounts or virtual currencies present in the ledger.<br/><br/>\nBy default, the private ledger is not connected to any blockchain. It is possible to create an application on it without any blockchain at all. Using Tatum Private Ledger and the building blocks included within it, it is possible to quickly swap the whole application from the ledger to any blockchain supported by Tatum. All of the API calls will remain the same, the only thing that changes is the blockchain the application lives on.<br/><br/>\nMost blockchains do not have any compliance layer at all. It is not possible to freeze funds at a blockchain address or deactivate an address. The Tatum Account has built-in compliance, and it is possible to block funds in the account, freeze outgoing transactions from the account or even completely deactivate the account.\n</p>\n","name":"Account"},{"description":"<p>An endpoint used to create and list transactions within Tatum Private Ledger.

For more information about Bitcoin transactions and UTXO, see the <a href=\"https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin user documentation</a>. To check UTXOs in a transaction, see the <a href=\"#operation/BtcGetUTXO\">API for getting information about a transaction output (UTXO) in a Bitcoin transaction</a>.</p>\n<p>You can build a BTC transaction by one of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sending BTC from blockchain addresses</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of addresses. For each address, the last 100 transactions are scanned for any UTXO to be included in the transaction. For easier control over the assets to be sent, we recommend that you use this method only if you have one address to send the assets from.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>BtcTransactionFromAddress</code> or <code>BtcTransactionFromAddressKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n<li><b>Sending BTC from UTXOs</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of UTXOs. Each UTXO is included in the transaction. Use this method if you want to manually calculate the amount to send.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>BtcTransactionFromUTXO</code> or <code>BtcTransactionFromUTXOKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an UTXO is entered into a transaction, the whole UTXO amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives two transactions, T1 with 1 BTC and T2 with 2 BTC. A transaction that consumes the UTXOs from both T1 and T2 will have an available amount of 3 BTC to spend:<br/><code>1 BTC (from T1) + 2 BTC (from T2) = 3 BTC (to spend in total)</code></p>\n<p>You can send the assets to one or multiple recipients in one transaction. If you send the assets to multiple addresses, each address must have its own amount to receive.</p>\n<p><b>Paying the gas fee and receiving the change</b><br/>\nWhen the amount that the recipients should receive is lower than the amount from the UTXOs, the difference between these two amounts is by default used as the gas fee for the transaction. Because this amount may be considerable and you may not want to spend it all on the gas fee, you can explicitly specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining after covering the fee will be sent (the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code> parameters in the request body, correspondingly).</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen sending BTC, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>\n","operationId":"BtcTransferBlockchain","requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"oneOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/BtcTransactionFromAddress"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/BtcTransactionFromAddressKMS"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/BtcTransactionFromUTXO"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/BtcTransactionFromUTXOKMS"}]}}},"required":true},"responses":{"200":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"oneOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/TransactionHash"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SignatureId"}]}}},"description":"OK"},"400":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/Error400"}}},"description":"Bad Request.

A UTXO is the amount of LTC that remains at a Litecoin address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving this address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency transaction. For more information about the UTXO, see the <a href=\"https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin user documentation</a>. To check UTXOs in a transaction, see the <a href=\"#operation/LtcGetUTXO\">API for getting information about a transaction output (UTXO) in a Litecoin transaction</a>.</p>\n<p>You can build a LTC transaction by one of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sending LTC from blockchain addresses</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of addresses. For each address, the last 100 transactions are scanned for any UTXO to be included in the transaction. For easier control over the assets to be sent, we recommend that you use this method only if you have one address to send the assets from.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>LtcTransactionAddress</code> or <code>LtcTransactionAddressKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n<li><b>Sending LTC from UTXOs</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of UTXOs. Each UTXO is included in the transaction. Use this method if you want to manually calculate the amount to send.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>LtcTransactionFromUTXO</code> or <code>LtcTransactionFromUTXOKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an UTXO is entered into a transaction, the whole UTXO amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives two transactions, T1 with 1 LTC and T2 with 2 LTC. A transaction that consumes the UTXOs from both T1 and T2 will have an available amount of 3 LTC to spend:<br/><code>1 LTC (from T1) + 2 LTC (from T2) = 3 LTC (to spend in total)</code></p>\n<p>You can send the assets to one or multiple recipients in one transaction. If you send the assets to multiple addresses, each address must have its own amount to receive.</p>\n<p><b>Paying the gas fee and receiving the change</b><br/>\nWhen the amount that the recipients should receive is lower than the amount from the UTXOs, the difference between these two amounts is by default used as the gas fee for the transaction. Because this amount may be considerable and you may not want to spend it all on the gas fee, you can explicitly specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining after covering the fee will be sent (the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code> parameters in the request body, correspondingly).</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen sending LTC, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API.

A UTXO is the amount of ADA that remains at a Cardano address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving this address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency transaction. For more information about the UTXO, see the <a href=\"https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin user documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>You can build an ADA transaction by one of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sending ADA from blockchain addresses</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of addresses. For each address, the last 100 transactions are scanned for any UTXO to be included in the transaction. For easier control over the assets to be sent, we recommend that you use this method only if you have one address to send the assets from.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>AdaTransactionFromAddress</code> or <code>AdaTransactionFromAddressKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n<li><b>Sending ADA from UTXOs</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of UTXOs. Each UTXO is included in the transaction. Use this method if you want to manually calculate the amount to send.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>AdaTransactionFromUTXO</code> or <code>AdaTransactionFromUTXOKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an UTXO is entered into a transaction, the whole UTXO amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives two transactions, T1 with 1 ADA and T2 with 2 ADA. A transaction that consumes the UTXOs from both T1 and T2 will have an available amount of 3 ADA to spend:<br/><code>1 ADA (from T1) + 2 ADA (from T2) = 3 ADA (to spend in total)</code></p>\n<p>You can send the assets to one or multiple recipients in one transaction. If you send the assets to multiple addresses, each address must have its own amount to receive.</p>\n<p><b>Paying the gas fee and receiving the change</b><br/>\nWhen the amount that the recipients should receive is lower than the amount from the UTXOs, the difference between these two amounts is by default used as the gas fee for the transaction. Because this amount may be considerable and you may not want to spend it all on the gas fee, you can explicitly specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining after covering the fee will be sent (the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code> parameters in the request body, correspondingly).</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>\nWhen sending ADA, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API.

Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.\n\nSecond mode enables you to mint on any custom NFT ERC-721 smart contract, on which specified minter address is approved as a minter. You don't specify private key or signatureId, only minter address, from which the NFT will be minted.<br/>\nIt means you perform mint multiple NFT request with following body:\n<pre>{\n   \"to\": [\"0x80d8bac9a6901698b3749fe336bbd1385c1f98f2\"],\n   \"url\": [\"ipfs://QmXJJ6UF5WkF4WTJvsdhiA1etGwBLfpva7Vr9AudGMe3pj\"],\n   \"tokenId\": [\"9876541124516\"],\n   \"contractAddress\":\"0xcd2ada00c48a27faa5cc67f9a1ed55b89ddf7f77\",\n   \"minter\": \"0x542b9ac4945a3836fd12ad98acbc76a0c8b743f5\",\n   \"chain\": \"MATIC\"\n}</pre>\nThe blockchain fee of the performed transaction is paid from the address connected with built-in private key and is debited in form of credits. The credits are debited only if NFT mint requests are performed with paid API key plan.\nWe transform fee to the credits in accordance to the rates provided by the Tatum.\nIf you want to batch mint on ERC-721 contract which is not deployed via Tatum API, your smart contract must contain this method:\n<pre>mintMultiple(address[] to, uint256[] tokenId, string[] uri): boolean</pre>\nYou can use addresses specified in the bellow table to be used as a minter.\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Chain</th>\n    <th>Testnet address</th>\n    <th>Mainnet Address</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MATIC</td>\n    <td>0x542b9ac4945a3836fd12ad98acbc76a0c8b743f5</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>BSC</td>\n    <td>0xc16ae5e8c985b906935a0cadf4e24f0400531883</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ONE</td>\n    <td>0x8906f62d40293ddca77fdf6714c3f63265deddf0</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ETH</td>\n    <td>0x53e8577C4347C365E4e0DA5B57A589cB6f2AB848</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>CELO</td>\n    <td>0xBC2eBA680EE50d685cc4Fe65f102AA70AfB27D3F</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>KLAY</td>\n    <td>0x80d8bac9a6901698b3749fe336bbd1385c1f98f2</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nIf there are not enough coins on any testnet address, feel free to send coins there.</p>\n","operationId":"NftMintMultipleErc721","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/TestnetTypeQuery"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/TestnetTypeHeader"}],"requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"oneOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftMinter"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNft"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftCelo"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftTron"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftFlowPK"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftFlowMnemonic"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftKMS"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftKMSCelo"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftKMSTron"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MintMultipleNftFlowKMS"}]}}},"required":true},"responses":{"200":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"oneOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/TransactionHash"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/FlowMintedMultipleResult"},{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SignatureId"}]}}},"description":"OK"},"400":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/Error400"}}},"description":"Bad Request.
