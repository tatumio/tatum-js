Tatum Private Ledger contains information about accounts, the customers that own the accounts, transactions that affect the accounts or virtual currencies present in the ledger.<br/><br/>\nBy default, the private ledger is not connected to any blockchain. It is possible to create an application on it without any blockchain at all. Using Tatum Private Ledger and the building blocks included within it, it is possible to quickly swap the whole application from the ledger to any blockchain supported by Tatum. All of the API calls will remain the same, the only thing that changes is the blockchain the application lives on.<br/><br/>\nMost blockchains do not have any compliance layer at all. It is not possible to freeze funds at a blockchain address or deactivate an address.

For each of the addresses, the last 100 transactions will be scanned for any unspent UTXO to be included in the transaction.</li>\n<li><b>fromUTXO</b> - assets will be sent from the list of unspent UTXOs. Each of the UTXOs will be included in the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In bitcoin-like blockchains, a transaction is created from the list of previously unspent UTXOs. Every UTXO contains the amount of funds that can be spent.</p>\n<p>When the UTXO is entered into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 BTC and T2 with 2 BTC. The transaction, which will consume the UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have an available amount to spend of 3 BTC = 1 BTC (T1) + 2 BTC(T2).</p>\n<p>There can be multiple recipients of the transactions. In the <b>to</b> section, every recipient address has its own corresponding amount. When the amount of funds that the recipient should receive is lower than the amount of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is used as a transaction fee.</p>\n<p><b>Signing a transaction</b></p>\n<p>When sending BTC, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API.

More assets you will support, more intial gas will be used for address creation. Batch mode adds more gas for every type.<br/>\nSupported blockchains:\n<ul>\n<li>Binance Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Harmony.ONE</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>TRON - without 1155</li>\n<li>Polygon (Matic)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n",

You can also block a percentage of the amount until the future trade has expired.\n</p>\n<p>Futures can also penalize contracting parties if they don’t have the agreed balance available in their accounts.\nThe penalty is calculated in the following way: Penalty amount = (Percentage of incomplete deal amount because of shortage from user) × (Maximum Penalty percentage of futures deal based on blocked amount and time interval) × (total blocked value).\n</p>\n<p>Example of the BTC/USDT trade future:</p>\n<p>The maker creates a sell with the following properties: 1 BTC at a price of 60000 USDT, with a blocking percentage of 22%, a penalty percentage of 45%, a system commision of 1% and with an expiration time of within 12 hours.</p>\n<pre>\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUTURE_SELL\",\n  \"price\": \"60000\",\n  \"amount\": \"1\",\n  \"pair\": \"BTC/USDT\",\n  \"currency1AccountId\": \"60a236db1b57f60d62612bf3\",\n  \"currency2AccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c241ac2920f\",\n  \"fee\": 1,\n  \"feeAccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c251ac2920a\",\n  \"attr\": {\n    \"sealDate\": 1621990960631,\n    \"percentBlock\": 22,\n    \"percentPenalty\": 45\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe taker accepts the offer with a buy and blocks 13200 USDT (60000 USDT × 0.22) in their account.\n<pre>\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUTURE_BUY\",\n  \"price\": \"60000\",\n  \"amount\": \"1\",\n  \"pair\": \"BTC/USDT\",\n  \"currency1AccountId\": \"60a236db1b57f60d62612bf2\",\n  \"currency2AccountId\": \"609d0696bf835c241ac2920a\",\n  \"attr\": {\n    \"sealDate\": 1621990960631,\n    \"percentBlock\": 22,\n    \"percentPenalty\": 45\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>At the time of the trade, the maker and taker have the following conditions.\nThe maker has 0.65 BTC (35% deficit) in their account and the taker has 49200 USDT (18% deficit) in their account.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe maker penalty is equal to 0.35 × 0.22 × (0.45 × 1 BTC) = 0.03465 BTC.\nThe taker penalty is equal to 0.18 × 0.22 × (0.45 × 60000 USDT) = 1069.2 USDT.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe system commission for the maker is 1 BTC × 1% = 0.01 BTC.\nThe system commission for the taker is 60000 USDT × 1% = 600 USDT.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe maker’s assets after deducting penalties and commissions equals 0.65 - 0.03465 - 0.01 = 0.60535 BTC.

If there are no unspent deposits, only last pool address 0 UTXO is used.\n    If balance of wallet is not sufficient, it is impossible to perform withdrawal from this account -> funds were transferred to another\n    linked wallet within system or outside of Tatum visibility.<br/>\n    For the first time of withdrawal from wallet, there must be some deposit made and funds are obtained from that. Since\n    there is no withdrawal, there was no transfer to pool address 0 and thus it is not present in vIn. Pool transfer is identified by missing data.address property in response.\n    When last not cancelled withdrawal is not completed and thus there is no tx id of output transaction given,\n    we cannot perform next withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <h4>ETH</h4>\n  <p>\n    Withdrawal from Tatum can be processed only from 1 account. In Ethereum Blockchain, each address is recognized as an account and only funds from that account can be sent in 1 transaction.\n    Example: Account A has 0.5 ETH, Account B has 0.3 ETH. Account A is linked to Tatum Account 1, Account B is linked to Tatum Account 2. Tatum Account 1 has balance 0.7 Ethereum and\n    Tatum Account 2 has 0.1 ETH. Withdrawal from Tatum Account 1 can be at most 0.5 ETH, even though balance in Tatum Private Ledger is 0.7 ETH.\n    Because of this Ethereum Blockchain limitation, withdrawal request should always contain sourceAddress, from which withdrawal will be made. To get available balances for Ethereum wallet accounts, use hint endpoint.\n  </p>\n  <h4>XRP</h4>\n  <p>\n    XRP withdrawal can contain DestinationTag except of address, which is placed in attr parameter of withdrawal request.\nSourceTag of the blockchain transaction should be withdrawal ID for autocomplete purposes of withdrawals.\n  </p>\n  <h4>XLM</h4>\n  <p>\n    XLM withdrawal can contain memo except of address, which is placed in attr parameter of withdrawal request. XLM blockchain does not have possibility to enter source account information.\n    It is possible to create memo in format 'destination|source', which is supported way of memo in Tatum and also there is information about the sender account in the blockchain.\n  </p>\n<br/>\nWhen withdrawal is created, all other withdrawals with the same currency are pending, unless the current one is marked as complete or cancelled.<br/>\nTatum ledger transaction is created for every withdrawal request with operation type WITHDRAWAL. The value of the transaction is the withdrawal amount + blockchain fee, which should be paid.\nIn the situation, when there is withdrawal for ERC20, XLM, or XRP based custom assets, the fee is not included in the transaction because it is paid in different assets than the withdrawal itself.\n</p>\n",

Each of the UTXO will be included in the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\nIn bitcoin-like blockchains, transaction is created from the list of previously not spent UTXO. Every UTXO contains amount of funds, which can be spent.\nWhen the UTXO enters into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 BCH and T2 with 2 BCH.\nThe transaction, which will consume UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have available amount to spent 3 BCH = 1 BCH (T1) + 2 BCH(T2).<br/><br/>\nThere can be multiple recipients of the transactions, not only one. In the <b>to</b> section, every recipient address has it's corresponding amount.\nWhen the amount of funds, that should receive the recipient is lower than the amount of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is used as a transaction fee.<br/><br/>\nThis operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds.

It is possible to build a blockchain transaction in 2 ways:\n<ul>\n<li><b>fromAddress</b> - assets will be sent from the list of addresses. For each of the addresses last 100 transactions will be scanned for any unspent UTXO and will be included in the transaction.</li>\n<li><b>fromUTXO</b> - assets will be sent from the list of unspent UTXOs. Each of the UTXO will be included in the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\nIn bitcoin-like blockchains, the transaction is created from the list of previously not spent UTXO. Every UTXO contains the number of funds, which can be spent.\nWhen the UTXO enters into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 LTC and T2 with 2 LTC.\nThe transaction, which will consume UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have available amount to spent 3 LTC = 1 LTC (T1) + 2 LTC(T2).<br/><br/>\nThere can be multiple recipients of the transactions, not only one. In the <b>to</b> section, every recipient address has it's corresponding amount.\nWhen the amount of funds, that should receive the recipient is lower than the number of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is used as a transaction fee.<br/><br/>\nThis operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.\n</p>\n",

This operation can be done on mainnet only for paid plans.</h4><br/>\n<p>Add public key to existing Flow blockchain addresses. Private key for that public key can be used for signing transaction.\nThere are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created:\n<ul>\n<li>Using mnemonic and index - private key is generated based on the index in the mnemonic.</li>\n<li>Using secret - private keys is entered manually.</li>\n</ul><br/><br/>\nThis operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.\n</p>\n",

For each of the addresses, the last 100 transactions will be scanned for any unspent UTXO to be included in the transaction.</li>\n<li><b>fromUTXO</b> - assets will be sent from the list of unspent UTXOs. Each of the UTXOs will be included in the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\nIn bitcoin-like blockchains, a transaction is created from the list of previously unspent UTXOs. Every UTXO contains the amount of funds that can be spent.\nWhen the UTXO is entered into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 ADA and T2 with 2 ADA.\nThe transaction, which will consume the UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have an available amount to spend of 3 ADA = 1 ADA (T1) + 2 ADA(T2).<br/><br/>\nThere can be multiple recipients of the transactions. In the <b>to</b> section, every recipient address has its own corresponding amount.\nWhen the amount of funds that the recipient should receive is lower than the amount of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is split as transaction fee and change, which will be send to change address..<br/><br/>\nThis operation requires the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send their private keys to the Internet because there is a strong possibility that they will be stolen and the funds will be lost. In this method, it is possible to enter a privateKey\nor signatureId. The privateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchains when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used to ensure the highest level of security, and the signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to use the Tatum Client Library for supported languages.\n</p>\n",

After the NFT is minted, you have to transfer it to the recipient's address. The recipient has to agree in advance to receive your NFT because Algorand charges users for storing NFTs on their addresses, and an Algorand blockchain address by default does not receive NFTs unless explicitly agreed.<br/>This how it works:\n<ol>\n<li>The recipient <a href=\"https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Algorand#operation/AlgorandBlockchainReceiveAsset\" target=\"_blank\">agrees to receive the NFT</a> to their address.</li>\n<li>You <a href=\"#operation/NftTransferErc721\">transfer the NFT</a> to the recipient's address (use the <code>transferNftAlgoExpress</code> schema of the request body).<br /><b>NOTE:</b> On the <b>mainnet</b>, Tatum covers your transaction fees for the NFT transfer and pays for them from its own blockchain address.

On the <b>testnet</b>, no credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>To mint NFTs on <b>Solana</b>, use this API with the <code>MintNftExpressSolana</code> schema of the request body.<br/>Solana uses the <a href=\"https://www.metaplex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Metaplex Protocol</a>, a smart contract and metadata standard for creating and working with NFTs. When you mint an NFT on Solana with NFT Express, the pre-built smart contract based on the Metaplex Protocol is used.<br/>When an NFT is minted on Solana, a new blockchain address is created to receive the NFT under the recipient's account address (the one in the <code>to</code> parameter of the request body). This address is returned in the <code>nftAccountAddress</code> parameter in the response body, is owned by the recipient's address, and has the same private key.<br/>The response body also returns the address of the minted NFT itself, which is held in the <code>nftAddress</code> parameter.<br/>After the NFT is minted, you have to <a href=\"#operation/NftTransferErc721\">transfer it</a> to the recipient's address (use the <code>transferNftSolana</code> or <code>transferNftSolanaKMS</code> schema of the request body).

Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey\nor signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.\nAlternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.\n\nSecond mode enables you to mint on any custom NFT ERC-721 smart contract, on which specified minter address is approved as a minter. You don't specify private key or signatureId, only minter address, from which the NFT will be minted.<br/>\nIt means you perform mint multiple NFT request with following body:\n<pre>{\n   \"to\": [\"0x80d8bac9a6901698b3749fe336bbd1385c1f98f2\"],\n   \"url\": [\"ipfs://QmXJJ6UF5WkF4WTJvsdhiA1etGwBLfpva7Vr9AudGMe3pj\"],\n   \"tokenId\": [\"9876541124516\"],\n   \"contractAddress\":\"0xcd2ada00c48a27faa5cc67f9a1ed55b89ddf7f77\",\n   \"minter\": \"0x542b9ac4945a3836fd12ad98acbc76a0c8b743f5\",\n   \"chain\": \"MATIC\"\n}</pre>\nThe blockchain fee of the performed transaction is paid from the address connected with built-in private key and is debitted in form of credits. The credits are debitted only if NFT mint requests are performed with paid API key plan.\nWe transform fee to the credits in accordance to the rates provided by the Tatum.\nIf you want to batch mint on ERC-721 contract which is not deployed via Tatum API, your smart contract must contain this method:\n<pre>mintMultiple(address[] to, uint256[] tokenId, string[] uri): boolean</pre>\nYou can use addresses specified in the bellow table to be used as a minter.\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Chain</th>\n    <th>Testnet address</th>\n    <th>Mainnet Address</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>MATIC</td>\n    <td>0x542b9ac4945a3836fd12ad98acbc76a0c8b743f5</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>BSC</td>\n    <td>0xc16ae5e8c985b906935a0cadf4e24f0400531883</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ONE</td>\n    <td>0x8906f62d40293ddca77fdf6714c3f63265deddf0</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ETH</td>\n    <td>0x53e8577C4347C365E4e0DA5B57A589cB6f2AB848</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>CELO</td>\n    <td>0xBC2eBA680EE50d685cc4Fe65f102AA70AfB27D3F</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>KLAY</td>\n    <td>0x80d8bac9a6901698b3749fe336bbd1385c1f98f2</td>\n    <td>0xcf9e127455d28e7362380aec1b92ddee8200b295</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nIf there are not enough coins on any testnet address, feel free to send coins there.</p>\n",

Once you are logged in,\n  you are automatically assigned the Free plan.\n  \n  With the Free plan:\n  * You get two API keys, one tied to the testnet of a blockchain and the other to the mainnet.\n  * You can make up to five API calls per second.\n  * The number of API calls per month is not limited.\n\n  When making an API call, provide the appropriate API key (testnet or mainnet) as either an HTTP header\n  or a path parameter of the API call.\n  \n  If you ever need your API keys, you can find them in [your Tatum account](https://dashboard.tatum.io/).\n\n* **Get an auto-generated API key attached to API calls.**\n  \n  Make an API call without any API key provided. The API key will be generated and tied to your IP address.\n  This API key is stored within the Tatum platform and is automatically attached to all your API calls.\n\n  With the auto-generated API key:\n  * You can make up to five API calls per second.\n  * You get 10,000,000 credits to spend on API calls within a month.\n  \n    The number of credits is reset on the first day of a month. The unused credits from the current month are not\n    rolled over to the next month.\n  \n  These limits are applied to both the testnet and mainnet.\n  \n  By default, API calls with the auto-generated API key are executed against the mainnet.\n  To make an API call to the testnet, add the `type` query parameter set to `testnet` to the endpoint URL,\n  for example:\n  \n  `https://api-eu1.tatum.io/v3/ledger/account?type=testnet`\n"
