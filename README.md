## Welcome

Tatum SDK is a powerful, feature-rich TypeScript/JavaScript library that streamlines the development of blockchain applications. Designed for developers looking to integrate various blockchain functionalities into their projects, Tatum SDK simplifies the process by providing a user-friendly and consistent interface to interact with a wide range of blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin, and many more.

With Tatum SDK, you can:

### Perform native RPC calls
Easily interact with different blockchains through native RPC calls, abstracting away the complexities of managing separate RPC clients for each blockchain.
### Create notifications
Monitor wallet activity with ease by setting up real-time notifications for events such as incoming and outgoing transactions, balance updates, and contract interactions.
### Access wallet information
Retrieve vital wallet details, including balances, transaction history, and other relevant information, all through a single interface.

Tatum SDK is constantly evolving, with new features and support for additional blockchains being added regularly.
This comprehensive library is the ideal choice for developers who are keen on building robust, scalable, and efficient blockchain applications without getting bogged down by the intricacies of working with multiple blockchain protocols.

This guide will walk you through the basic setup, installation, and usage of TatumSDK to help you harness the full potential of this library.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into TatumSDK, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have the latest LTS version installed.
- **npm**: npm is bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js should automatically install npm.

## Installation

To install TatumSDK, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

### Install using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```console
npm install @tatumcom/js
```

### Install using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```console
yarn add @tatumcom/js
```

### Install using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

```console
pnpm install @tatumcom/js
```

## Getting started

### Basic Usage

Here's a brief overview of how to utilize TatumSDK for RPC calls and subscribing to notifications.

### Initialization

Start by importing the TatumSDK library and initializing Ethereum client as follows:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })
```

### RPC Calls

To make RPC calls, use the available methods to interact with Ethereum blockchain. For example, to fetch the balance of a specific Ethereum address:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })

const balance = await tatum.rpc.getBalance('0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e')
console.log(`Balance: ${balance}`)
```

### Subscribing to Notifications

To subscribe to notifications for events related to a specified Ethereum address, choose a type of event you want to be notified about.
We are going to use `addressEvent` as an example, which sends you notification about any transfer on the address - native ones, ERC20 tokens or NFTs. To subscribe to this event, use the following code:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })

const response = await tatum.notification.subscribe.addressEvent({
  url: 'https://<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>',
  address: '0x690B9A9E9aa1C9dB991C7721a92d351Db4FaC990',
})

console.log(response)
// ðŸŽ‰  Now your address is subscribed for any events!
```

### Get NFT balance of a wallet

Using TatumSDK, obtain the NFT balance of an address by calling the getNFTBalance method within the NFT submodule and passing the target address as an argument. This streamlined process efficiently retrieves the total number of NFTs owned by the specified address. To achieve this, use the following code:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum, NftAddressBalance } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })

const balances: NftAddressBalance[] = await tatum.nft.getBalance({
  addresses: ['0x53e8577c4347c365e4e0da5b57a589cb6f2ab849'],
})

console.log(balances)
```

### Connect to MetaMask and send transaction

Using TatumSDK, it's possible to connect your browser application to MetaMask and perform transactions using it. To achieve this, use the following code:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })

const account: string = await tatum.walletProvider.metaMask.connect()
const txId: string = await tatum.walletProvider.metaMask.transferNative(
  '0x53e8577C4347C365E4e0DA5B57A589cB6f2AB848',
  '1',
)

console.log(txId)
```

### Get exchange rates

Using TatumSDK, obtain current fiat/crypto exchange rates To achieve this, use the following code:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM })

const res = await tatum.rates.getCurrentRate('BTC', 'EUR')

console.log(res.data)
```

### Get current fees

Using TatumSDK, you can obtain recommended fee/gas price for a blockchain. Supported blockchains are:

- `Bitcoin`
- `Litecoin`
- `Dogecoin`
- `Ethereum`

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({
  network: Network.ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA,
  verbose: true,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  retryCount: 2,
  version: ApiVersion.V1,
})

const result = await tatum.fee.getCurrentFee()

console.log(result.data)
```

### Get token balance

Using TatumSDK, obtain all fungible token balances of an address by calling the getBalance method within the `token` submodule and passing the target address as an argument. This streamlined process efficiently retrieves all balances for fungible tokens that specified address holds. To achieve this, use the following code:

```ts
import { TatumSDK, Network, Ethereum } from '@tatumcom/js'

const tatum = await TatumSDK.init<Ethereum>({ network: Network.ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA })

const { data: balances } = await tatum.token.getBalance({
  addresses: ['0x2cbaf358c0af93096bd820ce57c26f0b7c6ec7ab'],
})

console.log(balances)
```
