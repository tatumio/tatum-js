     * Generate XDC wallet
     * <p><b>1 credit per API call</b></p>
     * <p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase.
     * Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.
     * <br/>
     * Each address is identified by 3 main values:
     * <ul><li>Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed</li>
     * <li>Public Key - public address to be published</li>
     * <li>Derivation index - index of generated address</li></ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for XDC wallet with derivation path m'/44'/550'/0'/0.
     * More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki</a>.
